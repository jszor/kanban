# Kanban Board

This project is a simple Kanban Board application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and rearrange tasks across different columns representing different stages of a workflow: Backlog, In Progress, Complete, and On Hold.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to any column.
- **Edit Tasks**: Click on a task to edit its content.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks by leaving the content empty.
- **Drag and Drop**: Rearrange tasks within a column or move them to another column.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.

## To do:

- Improve visual feedback to the user when rearranging items in column.
